    "a. $P(X = n) = 1 \\space\\forall n$\n",

    "2. Efrat built a classifier which can tell if a given image is of a cat, with 99% precision. I.e. $P(cat | classifier \\space says \\space cat) = 0.99$.\n",
    "Efrat's classifier's recall is 90%. I.e. $P(classifier \\space says \\space cat | cat) = 0.90$. Which of the following is correct regarding the prevalence of cats images in Efrat's data, i.e. $P(cat)$?\n",

    "a. We cannot calculate this probability and in fact it could be very low, lower than 1%\n",

    "c. We can calculate this probability\n",

    "3. In Oded's shop the number of Optimus Prime transformers sold every day, is Poisson distributed with an average of 2. On Sunday morning Oded notices he is left without Optimus Prime transformers! How many should he order so that probability of running out of Optimus Primes until next Sunday morning (i.e. exactly 7 days) is less than 5%? You can assume Oded's order will instantly arrive and please consider using `scipy.stats.poisson` for the final answer.\n",

What is the expected number of experiments \"reaching the wrong conclusion\" in a typical Researcher's academic life, and what is the probability that a typical Researcher would \"reach the wrong conclusion\" in at least 1 experiment during her academic life?\n",
